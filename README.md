# WWDC21 Submission - Combustion Demo

## Status: Accepted!

This is my playground for WWDC21's [Swift Student Challenge](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/swift-student-challenge/). I decided to create a Swift Playground to teach users about combustion reactions, a small part of organic chemistry. It uses SwiftUI and SpriteKit to create a mini "lab."

## Installation

Download the `Combustion Demo.playgroundbook`, and run it in Swift Playgrounds 3.4.1 on macOS 11.2.3.
